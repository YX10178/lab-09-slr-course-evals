###the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. 
##The article titled, “Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity” (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings.

##The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin.
##In addition, six students rated the professors’ physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman and Hill, 2007).) 

##The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors.

#The dataset we’ll be using is called evals from the openintro package. Take a peek at the codebook with ?evals.
#463 courses
#23 variables.
